SoloHelper Program Readme

Currently I am running this only from eclipse with arguments format:
arg1 = Mode [INTERACTIVE | SESSION]
arg2 = music file (mp3 only currently) path
arg3 = session file path (only applicable for session mode.

To run from command line, one should create an executible jar (option in
eclipse) and that should include all the jars in the lib.
